learning_ruby
=============

I'm learning ruby by creating a Tic Tac Toe game.

In order to play the game you should first git clone a copy of this repository. Then 'chmod +x bin/tictactoe'
to change the bash mode so that you can run the bash executable by running 'bin/tictactoe'. Follow the directions
to play against the UNBEATABLE (I dare you to try!) computer or against one of your unsuspecting friends in 
two-player mode.
