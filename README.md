learning_ruby
=============

I'm learning ruby by creating a Tic Tac Toe game.

1.) In your terminal, enter ‘gem install pszals_ttt’.
2.) Enter 'tictactoe'
3.) Follow the instructions to play a game of tic tac toe against a friend, computer, or yourself!

Alternatively, you should first 'git clone' a copy of this repository. Then,
on your command line, 'chmod +x bin/tictactoe' to change the bash mode so that you can 
run the bash executable by running 'bin/tictactoe'. Follow the directions to play against 
the UNBEATABLE (I dare you to try!) computer or against one of your unsuspecting friends 
in two-player mode.
